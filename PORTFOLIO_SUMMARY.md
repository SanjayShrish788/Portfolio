### **2. About Me Section**
**Content:**
```
I'm a 3rd-year Computer Science and Engineering student at BMS Institute of 
Technology and Management, Bengaluru. My academic focus is on Machine Learning 
and Data Science, where I've been building projects to understand how algorithms 
work and how data can be used to solve real problems. I've worked with supervised 
learning models, natural language processing, and data analysis through coursework 
and personal projects.

I enjoy breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts and applying 
what I learn in class to practical scenarios. Whether it's building a classification 
model for medical data or analyzing sentiment from text, I focus on understanding 
the fundamentals and improving my implementation skills. I'm also active in 
hackathons, which help me learn to work under time constraints and collaborate 
with peers.

I'm currently strengthening my foundation in core CS subjects like Data Structures, 
Algorithms, and Database Management while exploring advanced topics in Machine 
Learning. I'm looking for internship opportunities where I can apply my skills, 
learn from experienced professionals, and contribute to meaningful projects.
